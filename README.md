My paper: "Foreground Object Sensing for Saliency Detection",
June 2016 ICMR '16: Proceedings of the 2016 ACM on International Conference on Multimedia Retrieval.

Many state-of-the-art saliency detection algorithms rely on the boundary prior, but these algorithms simply suppose the boundaries around an image as background regions. Here we propose a fast and effective algorithm for salient object detection. First, a novel method is proposed to approximately locate the foreground object by using the ...
